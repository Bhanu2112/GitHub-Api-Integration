# GitHub API Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate with the GitHub API to manage repositories, branches, and other resources programmatically. It allows users to create and manage GitHub repositories, retrieve information about branches, and perform various actions using the GitHub REST API.

## Features

- **Repository Creation**: Create new repositories on GitHub with specified attributes such as name, description, and visibility.
- **Branch Management**: Create, delete, and manage branches within repositories.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure access to the GitHub API using OAuth tokens for authentication.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage API responses and exceptions gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for implementing the service.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for building the application and managing dependencies.
- **JUnit & Mockito**: Used for unit testing and mocking dependencies during testing.
- **JSON**: For handling data exchange between the application and the GitHub API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
